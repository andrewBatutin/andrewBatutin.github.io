Prefrace
------------

Below you can find sample of how SonarQube service can be calibrated for a need of a specific project. 

Introduction
------------

SonarQube is using SQALE **(Software Quality Assessment based on
Lifecycle Expectations)** model in order to determine quality of the
source code.

Main characteristic of the SQALE model are:

-   The SQALE Quality Model is based on ISO 9126

-   The SQALE Method’s Quality Model takes the software’s lifecycle
    into account.  

-   The SQALE method provides common language to all teams. Its metrics
    can be used for any technology. And analysis results are comparable.

According to the SQALE each organization has to define it’s own concrete
definition of the right code. As well as calibrate the metrics to adjust
project-specific parameters.

In this document next SQALE elements will be reviewed taking in account
Vodoo project requirements:

-   SQALE Technical Debt Pyramid

-   Platform specific rules Severity

-   SQALE Rating definition

Reviewing procedure was done by Expert Team. Expert Team consisted from
iOS, Android, Web domains experts and Vodoo management staff.

SQALE Technical Debt Pyramid
----------------------------

According to ISO 9126 SQALE defines next Quality Model’s Characteristics


| **Name**            |
|-----------------|
| Reusability     |
| Portability     |
| Maintainability |
| Security        |
| Efficiency      |
| Changeability   |
| Reliability     |
| Testability     |
{:.mbtablestyle}


According to Vodoo project necessities Expert Team has defined next
priorities for the Quality Characteristics


| **Name**        | **Priority (0-10)** |
|:---------------:|:-------------------:|
| Reusability     | 10                  |
| Portability     | 9                   |
| Maintainability | 8                   |
| Security        | 7                   |
| Efficiency      | 7                   |
| Changeability   | 6                   |
| Reliability     | 5                   |
| Testability     | 2                   |
{:.mbtablestyle}


So Reliability characteristics are the most important one. And
Portability is the least important one.

According the Prioritized Quality Characteristics next Technical Debt
Pyramid was formed:

**Technical Debt Pyramid**

Quality Characteristics Priority can be changed according to the
Business needs of the project.

Each Quality Characteristics has platform specific rules set associated
with it. And they will be reviewed next.

Platform Specific Rules Set Severity Review
-------------------------------------------

Each Quality Characteristics has platform specific rules set associated
with it. And violations of these rules are used as an input to calculate
Technical Debt of the project.

Also each rule has its severity. And the severity depends on Quality
Characteristic type of the specific rule. In general higher Priority of
the rule’s Quality Characteristic type - higher it’s severity should be.

According to the above-mentioned criteria the Expert Team has reviewed
existing rule’s severity for iOS, Android, Web platforms.

Industrial standard rules set were taken as a baseline.

The reviewed rule’s severity is going to determine the priority of the
related Technical Debt “interest payment”.

Rule’s severity can be changed according to the Business needs.

SQALE Rating Definition
-----------------------

In order to relatively evaluate amount of Technical Debt in the project
2 metrics were taken into the consideration:

-   Technical Debt Ratio

-   SQALE Rating

Technical Debt Ratio - is the relationship between estimated technical
debt amount and estimated project amount. For instance:

Technical Debt - 5 m/d

Project Duration - 100 m/d

Technical Debt Ratio = Technical Debt / Project Duration

Technical Debt Ratio = 5 / 100 = 5%

Technical Debt is calculated based on amount of violated Rules for a
specific platform.

Next table determines relationship between SQALE Rating and Technical
Debt Ratio:

| **SQALE Rating** | **Technical Debt Ratio** |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| A                | 0 - 5%                   |
| B                | 5% - 10%                 |
| C                | 10% - 20%                |
| D                | 20% - 50%                |
| E                | 50% - 100%               |
{:.mbtablestyle}

The relationship is the industrial standard set by SonarQube.

The relationship can be reviewed according to the Business needs of the
specific project.

Conclusion
----------

SonarQube is using SQALE model to measure quality of the software
product. SQALE model is the projection of the ISO 9126. This quality
model is provides common quality metrics for the different platforms
used in the project. Quality metrics are defined by the set of Quality
Characteristics and platform specific pules sets. Priority of these
parameters is based on conclusions of the Expert Team. And can be
adjusted according to the Business needs.

SQALE Rating and Technical Debt Ratio are cumulative metrics that can be
used in order to evaluate project quality and compare one project to
another.

This document can be used as a baseline for Vodoo project quality
assessment.
