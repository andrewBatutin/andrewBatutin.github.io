Preface
------------


Introduction
------------

Assume team structure is a constant

Who are we?
------------

Understand your team and it's limitations and capabilities

- How many of you are there?
- What's your level?
- What's your motives?

Where are we?
------------

- Are we making a product?
- Are we doing it-consulting?
- Are we in big company?
- Are we in small company?
- Are we at start/mid/end of big/medium/small project?
- Are we at maintenance stage?

Where are we going?
------------

- Are we aiming for a major release?
- Are we going for a simple PoC?
- Are we at the start of Big Project?
- Are we at the end of the Small Project?

Build your tech web based on answers to the questions, not on your likes/dislikes
Same goes for management techniques. Agile for maintenance - not that good of an idea. Same for a waterfall for the PoC/RnD projects

Conclusion
----------

Software craft is a dynamic process of making hundreds of decisions under serious time constrains with constant lack of information. So there are no silver bullet answers for all of the projects and teams. But there are correct answers for your project and your team.
